This example uses clmtracker along with p5.js and p5.dom.js. Make sure you have version 0.1.5 or higher of p5.dom.js - you can grab it [here](https://github.com/lmccart/p5.js/blob/master/lib/addons/p5.dom.js).

You will need to run this with a local server, see this [tutorial](https://github.com/lmccart/p5.js/wiki/Local-server) for help.

* https://github.com/auduno/clmtrackr - download of clmtrackr.js and models.
* http://p5js.org - download of p5.js and p5.dom.js.
